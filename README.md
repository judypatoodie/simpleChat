# Simple Chat

Simple Chat is a chat application that users can send real-time messages to each other. The chat simulates a single chatroom, where many different users can send messages at a time. Users are also able to set their username to identify themselves.

## Getting Started

### Set up
1. In your terminal, clone the git repo into a directory of your choice
2. `cd` into the newly cloned repo
3. Run `npm install` to install all the node modules
4. Run `npm start` to start the application
5. In your browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`to view the live App!

## How to
**Send Messages**: Type in the input box at the bottom of the screen and click the `Send` button. See your messages in the chat box! Users who do not set their username will have their messages sent as an `Anonymous` user.

**Set Username**: To set your username, type in the input box at the top of the screen and click the `Set Username` button. Now, when you send messages, you will see it being sent from the username you have set!
